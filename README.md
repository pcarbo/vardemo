#vardemo

This small repository contains MATLAB code demonstrating the use of
importance sampling, Laplace's method and a variational approximation
for a small logistic regression example.

[vardemo.m](vardemo.m) is the MATLAB script that runs the main example.

For a detailed derivation of the variational lower bound, see
[bishop.pdf](bishop.pdf).
