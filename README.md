#vardemo

This small repository contains MATLAB code demonstrating the use of
importance sampling, Laplace's method and a variational approximation
for a small logistic regression example. The overall purpose of this
repository is to illustrate the use of non-Monte Carlo methods for
computing posterior quantities and other integrals (e.g. the marginal
likelihood) when we do not have a closed-form solution for these
integrals.

[vardemo.m](vardemo.m) is the MATLAB script that runs the main example.

I've also provided the mathematical derivations of Laplace's method
and the variational method; see [notes.pdf](notes.pdf).
